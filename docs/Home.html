<p><strong>Project Description</strong><br>
ANPR MX is a simple Automatic Plate Recognition DLL for ordinary North American type plates. (It won't identify &quot;European&quot; type ones.)<br>
<br>
It uses OpenCV for image processing and is capable of analyzing images with a maximum resolution of 800x600 or lower. ( *.jpg / *.png) file formats allowed.<br>
<br>
The code is partially based on the JavaANPR project, which is owned by Ondrej Martinsky.<br>
(See: http://javaanpr.sourceforge.net for details.)<br>
<br>
However, the following things were modified:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code entirely written in C# using VS 2010 and the .NET Framework 4.0 </li><li>Uses OpenCV instead of the java.awt libraries. </li><li>Replaces the plate band finding algorithm with a different approach based on OpenCV Blobs.
</li><li>Recognizes the North American average plate size only. <span style="text-decoration:underline">
It won't work for the European type plates.</span> </li></ul>
<p><br>
The library is simple and ready to be used on commercial or open source projects as it is licensed under the new BSD format.<br>
<br>
To make it easy for anyone to understand how the DLL works, I also provided an executable that shows its capabilities.<br>
You can also download a series of random car photos to test it. (See the &quot;Downloads&quot; section.)<br>
<br>
<strong>IMPORTANT</strong><br>
Please make sure you agree with the following licenses before you proceed to use this software:</p>
<ul>
<li>BSD (for OpenCV and ANPR MX) </li><li>LGPL 3 (for linking to OpenCVSharp) </li></ul>
